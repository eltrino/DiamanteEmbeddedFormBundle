# DiamanteDesk EmbeddedForm Bundle #

EmbeddedForm bundle extends OroEmbeddedFormBundle functionality. To create a ticket from a third party in DiamanteDesk it is required to add an additional form type and a controller.  

For more information about the Embedded Form, please see **Oro/Bundle/EmbeddedFormBundle/README.md**.

### Requirements ###

DiamanteDesk supports OroCRM version 1.8+.

### Installation ###

**Step 1:** Add as dependency in composer:

```bash
composer require diamante/embeddedform-bundle:dev-master
```

**Step 2:** Execute the following command:

```bash
php app/console diamante:embeddedform:schema
```

**Step 3:** Install assets in a usual way through Symfony:

```bash
php app/console assets:install
```

### Configuration ###

    provider:                       chain_provider
